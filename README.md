This is a Filebroser project for Ubuntu Phone design. a user can navigate the folder and see the content of the files in the directories. For security reasons, it uses "template": "unconfined" so that it can browse the whole file system of the phone.

When you navigate the browsers:

- swiping from right to left will go back to the previous folder
- swiping from left to right on the folder item will bring you to the next folder
